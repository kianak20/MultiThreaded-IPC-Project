# MultiThreaded-IPC-Project
CS 3502 Project 1 Multi-threaded and IPC-based banking simulation with deadlock handling and performance testing


## Overview
This project demonstrates multi-threading, inter-process communication (IPC), and deadlock prevention techniques using C#. It includes:
- Multi-threaded bank account transactions**
- Safe resource handling using Mutex**
- Deadlock creation and prevention strategies**
- Inter-process communication using named pipes**
- Performance benchmarking and error handling tests**

## Features
Multi-threaded banking operations  
Deadlock handling & prevention  
Named pipe-based IPC (Producer-Consumer model)  
Performance benchmarking & error handling  

## Getting Started
